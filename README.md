## Backend and Storage

This app leverages [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) for most backend services including user authentication, database management, and file storage. Appwrite simplifies the backend development by providing APIs and SDKs for various services.

### How Appwrite is Used

- **Authentication:** Appwrite's authentication services are used to manage user sign-up, login, and authentication.
- **Database:** Appwrite's built-in database is used for managing video metadata and user interactions.
- **File Storage:** Videos and thumbnails are stored using Appwrite's file storage services.
